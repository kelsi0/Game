    for i in '''
        You awake in a dimly lit room, vaguely aware of a throbbing coming from somewhere deep in your head, or is it below you in the house? You push yourself up off the filthy rotting floorboards and hear the scuttle of what you hope is a rat. There is enough moonlight filtering in through the thick dusty curtains to make out what appears to be 4 doors. Each scrawled with a letter in what you hope is not blood.
        The wind howls and rattles the thin window panes but then you realise that the howling is coming from inside the house. The dust picks up around you and a show detaches itself from the rest. 
        The figure in front of you is that of a tall thin man wearing a beanie and frameless glasses. You are frozen with fright. He bends, until his face is inches from your own and he asks ***** There is another gust of wind and you are unsure if the apparition of the man was a bad fever dream.
        You look at the doors and choose which to go through. A,B,C or D

# NOTE: Question 2
    for i in '''
        Your hand trembles from the cold and you push the door open, how did it get so cold so quickly? Your breath comes quick and frosts in the air in front of you. As you progress into the next room you recognise that it is empty apart from a few old deflated footballs. Above the fireplace you spot a ragged old shirt. As your eyes adjust to the dark you notice that it has been pulled over a shapeless bulk. You stumble further inside. You hope that the bulk did not twitch as you look around the room and that it is a pentagon with 4 additional doors caked in mud and with grass growing in the letters A,B,C and D. You glance back up at the flickering fireplace and notice that the shirt, and the bulk are no longer there. Cautiously you move closer to the fireplace which is steadily dying. It flickers out just as you reach it and the cold descends again.
        Frozen, fetid breath envelops your neck before you turn around and come face to face with the mottled flesh of a young man long dead, a close cut hairstyle now patchy. As he opens his mouth to speak bile, blood and saliva pours down his ripped football shirt. Beneath the rolling eyes his mouth moves spraying you with the disgusting liquid. ***** You take a step back and trip, falling backwards into the fireplace. The logs are surprisingly cold. As you push yourself up, you realise the man has vanished. Squinting, you choose a door.
